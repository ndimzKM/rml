# What am I really building
A platform for students to be able to rate their lecturers/teachers.
This is to make sure students always choose the best lecturers/teachers
that suit thier preferences and ones they believe they will be able to 
get the most out of.
It is also to make sure students don't end up discouraged due to 
uncompatibilities between them and the lecturers/teachers

## Pages
1. Home page with search bar to search schools and lecturers/teachers
2. Dashboard-ish, for users to be able to control their ratings and more.
3. Main Search Page, for students to be able to navigate between available lecturers/teachers. Kinda like seach results from Google

## What can a user do?
1. View all lecturers/teachers
2. View all schools
3. Filter by class, course, departments, e.t.c
